Hello everyone! I'm Lucas, and I'm excited to start this new project: my own blog about my experience learning Flutter.

## Who I am?

Before we dive into the fascinating world of Flutter, let me tell you a little about myself. I'm Lucas Casco, software engineer. My journey in software development began in school, where some classmates and I developed a video game using Construct 2. After finishing school and entering university, I became interested in web development with React. Although I have explored various technologies, Flutter has completely captured my interest as of late.

## How did my interest in Flutter emerge?

The story behind my interest in Flutter is quite peculiar. A college friend told me about an interesting project; Initially, I thought of using React Native because of my previous experience. However, a few weeks later, I attended a technology seminar at university, where my professor talked about mobile app development with Flutter. The versatility and efficiency of Flutter attracted me from the beginning, and here I am, ready to share my learnings with you. If you're wondering what happened to the project, absolutely nothing, as expected.

## The Purpose of This Blog

Now, let's talk about the purpose of this digital space. This blog will not only document my personal progress with Flutter, but will also serve as a resource for anyone who is just starting out on this journey or looking to improve their mobile app development skills. I plan to share my successes, failures, challenges, and everything I learn along this path.

I'm excited to have you on board as we explore the vast and exciting world of Flutter together. Let's start this journey together!

See you soon!
